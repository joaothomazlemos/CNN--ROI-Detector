# CNN-ROI-Detector
In this project, I wanted to apply transfear learning, with a pre-trained model YOLOv4, with the goal of performing detection on two Regions: Face and Forehead. I did this to use as a method tecnique for my masters.
The pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network model was created by Alexey Bochkovskiy, et. Al., and was State-of-Art at the time.
For this task, I downloaded thermographic images from the public domain http://tdface.ece.tufts.edu/, them I used the labelImg to label the forehead (testa) and face, as shown in the image below.
